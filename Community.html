                    I have extensive experience working with adolescents. My approach is rooted in Social Recovery Therapy and Registered Mink Therapy. Whether you're dealing with Friends, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric, or Batteries, you deserve a counselor who understands you. My therapy style is authentic and conversational. As a therapist, I work hard to create the sense of safety by talking 'with' you and not 'at' you. I will never judge; I understand. I believe everyone heals differently.
